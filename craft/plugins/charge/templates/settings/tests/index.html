    <h1>Testing</h1>

    <p>These testing functions are designed for developers to quickly debug issues. <br/>They can trigger events and conditions that normally require more complex external setup.</p>
    <p><em>They are not designed for general usage. Use with caution.</em></p>

    <hr/>

    <h2>Test Recurring Triggers</h2>
    <p>The <code>onRecurring</code> action is triggered against the <code>invoice.payment_succeeded</code> webhook event.</p>
    <p>This test creates a new charge with a recurring action, then triggers the recurring payment event.</p>

    <form method="post">
        {{ forms.hidden({ name: 'action', value: 'charge/tests/runTest' }) }}
        {{ forms.hidden({ name: 'type', value: 'recurringTrigger' }) }}
        <input type="submit" value="Run Test" class="btn submit"/>
    </form>
