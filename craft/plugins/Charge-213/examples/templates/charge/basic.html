    <h2>Basic Payment</h2>
    <p>This is a basic payment form. We're setting a set payment amount of $99.99, and then collecting only the simplest of customer details.</p>
    <p>This payment form is a great place to start when getting started with Charge.</p>

    <hr/>

    {#
        You'll see this form uses a number of includes and macros to function.
        This is primarly so our demos are all consistent and easily portable.
        Your own templates don't need to break things down as abstract if you don't want
