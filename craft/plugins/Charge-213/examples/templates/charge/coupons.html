    <h2>Coupons</h2>
    <p>This payment form follows the same setup as the basic payment form, but now includes the option to specify a coupon.</p>
    <p>The coupons are defined in the CP > Charge > Settings > Coupons, and can be either fixed value, or percentage based, and apply to either one-time, or recurring payments. Recurring payment coupons also can have additional usage limitations, such to make them only available for [x] recurring periods. ie. Apply a 50% discount to the first 3 payments, before reverting back to the full original value.</p>
    <p>By default we validate a coupon's state as part of the payment request, but there is an additional ajax only endpoint <code>charge/coupon/validate</code> that you can use to validate the state of a coupon, withouth submitting a payment request. The ajax endpoint will also return the specific information about a coupon code, so you can show how the discount will affect the payment. </p>
