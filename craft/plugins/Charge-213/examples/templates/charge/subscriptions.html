    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>In addition to other triggers after payments, we can add users to membership subscriptions.</p>
    <p>Subscriptions are defined within the Charge > Settings > Subscriptions area, and have various settings to control a user's member group, and various emails.</p>
    <p>When a user joins a subscription they're added to a specific member group for the duration their payment is active. When their payment ends (or fails) they're automatically removed from that member group.</p>
    <p>This works exactly as the other payment forms, but with the details of the subscription added as a new paramter on
        the options array.</p>

        You'll see this form uses a number of includes and macros to function.
        This is primarly so our demos are all consistent and easily portable.
        Your own templates don't need to break things down as abstract if you don't want
